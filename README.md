# LLM Experiments

This repository collects small experiments and utilities related to large language models. The top-level structure is simple:

- One directory per experiment
- Each directory is named appropriately for the experiment (e.g., openhands-api-client)
- Experiments can be small apps, research notes, scripts, or both

Contributions should add a new directory for each experiment, include a short README explaining purpose and usage, and keep dependencies isolated within that directory when possible.
